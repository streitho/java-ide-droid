# Release number logic #

My releases are numbered x.y.z like 0.7.3 <br>
What is the logic behind this numbering?<br>
<br>
<ul><li>x: major release, massiv code restructuring / rewriting<br>
</li><li>y: feature release, adding new features<br>
</li><li>z: release contains no new features, only bug fixing and internal task completion
